    """Simulate a model on a regular grid of times, using a function (closure)
    for advancing the state of the model

    This function simulates single realisation of a model on a regular
    grid of times using a function (closure) for advancing the state
    of the model, such as created by ‘stepGillespie’ or
    ‘stepCLE’.

    Parameters
    ----------
    key: JAX random number key
        An unused random number key.
    x0: array of numbers
        The intial state of the system at time t0
    t0: float
        This intial time to be associated with the intial state.
    tt: float
        The terminal time of the simulation.
    dt: float
        The time step of the output. Note that this time step relates only to
        the recorded output, and has no bearing on the accuracy of the simulation
        process.
    stepFun: function
        A function (closure) for advancing the state of the process,
        such as produced by ‘stepGillespie’ or ‘stepCLE’.

    Returns
    -------
    A matrix with rows representing the state of the system at successive times.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import jax
    >>> import jsmfsb.models
    >>> lv = jsmfsb.models.lv()
    >>> stepLv = lv.stepGillespie()
    >>> jsmfsb.simTs(jax.random.key(42), lv.m, 0, 100, 0.1, stepLv)

    """Simulate a many realisations of a model at a given fixed time in the
    future given an initial time and state, using a function (closure) for
    advancing the state of the model

    This function simulates many realisations of a model at a given
    fixed time in the future given an initial time and state, using a
    function (closure) for advancing the state of the model , such as
    created by ‘stepGillespie’ or ‘stepCLE’.

    Note that this function is vectorised using `jax.vmap` rather than `jax.lax.map`.
    This is usually (but not always) faster, especially on GPUs and TPUs. Note
    that `simSampleMap` is identical except that it is vectorised using `jax.lax.map`.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    key: JAX random number key
        An unused random number key.
    n: int
        The number of samples required.
    x0: array of numbers
        The intial state of the system at time t0.
    t0: float
        The intial time to be associated with the initial state.
    deltat: float
        The amount of time in the future of t0 at which samples of the
        system state are required.
    stepFun: function
        A function (closure) for advancing the state of the process,
        such as produced by `stepGillespie' or `stepCLE'.

    Returns
    -------
    A matrix with rows representing simulated states at time t0+deltat.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import jax
    >>> import jsmfsb.models
    >>> lv = jsmfsb.models.lv()
